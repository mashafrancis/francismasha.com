**Elastic Agent** is a single, unified way to add monitoring for logs, metrics, and
other types of data to a host. It can also protect hosts from security threats,
query data from operating systems, forward data from remote services or hardware,
and more. A single agent makes it easier and faster to deploy monitoring
across your infrastructure. Each agent has a single policy you can update to
add integrations for new data sources, security protections, and more.

**Fleet** provides a UI in Kibana that will help us to enroll and centrally manage all of our Elastic Agents.
