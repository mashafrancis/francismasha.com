## What is Truncate?

Truncate means to make something shorter, especially by cutting off the top or end. In paragraphs, we make the string shorter by cutting the lines.

```html
Lorem Ipsum is simply a dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s
when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type
specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into
electronic typesetting.
```

The above paragraph contains 4 lines and we want to make it short to two lines. like this

```html
Lorem Ipsum is simply a dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.
Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
when....
```

## How to use it?

First, let's take a look at how my HTML is looking-

### HTML

```html
<div class="container">
  <h3>Truncate (two line)</h3>
  <p class="truncate">
    Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the
    1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to
    make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also
    the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It
    was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing
    Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software
    like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
  </p>
</div>
```

So as you can see I've applied the `truncate-1` class to the paragraph. This class contains the following properties-

### CSS

```css
.truncate {
  display: -webkit-box;
  -webkit-line-clamp: 2; /* Change the number as per your requirement */
  -webkit-box-orient: vertical;
  overflow: hidden;
}
```
