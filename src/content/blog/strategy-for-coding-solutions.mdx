These are strategies for tackling data structures and algorithms in coding questions.

## If the given input is a sorted (array, list, or matrix), then we will be using a variation of Binary Search or a Two Pointers strategy

## If we are dealing with top/maximum/minimum/closest 'k' elements among 'n' elements, we will be using a Heap

## If we need to try all combination (or permutations) of the input, we can either use recursive Backtracking or iterative Breadth-First Search.

## Most of the questions related toTrees or Graphs can be solved either through Breadth-First Search or Depth-First Search.

## Every recursive solution can be converted to an iterative solution using a stack.

## If for a problem, there exists a brute-force solution in O(n2) time and O(1) space, there must exist two other solutions: 1) Using a Map or a Set for O(n) time and O(n) space, 2) Using sorting for O(n log n) time and O(1) space.

## If the problem is asking for optimization (e.g., maximization or minimization), we will need to use Dynamic Programming to solve it.

## If we need to find some common substring among a set of strings, we will be using a HashMap or a Trie.

## If we need to search among a bunch of strings, Trie will be the best data structure.

## If the problem involves a LinkedList and we can't use extra space, then use Fast & Slow Pointer approach.
