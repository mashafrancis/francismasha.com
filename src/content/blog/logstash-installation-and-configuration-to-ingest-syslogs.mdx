Logstash is a powerful free and open-source tool that receives data from different sources, parses it and sends it to a destination.
In this post, I will show you how to install and configure Logstash to ingest Syslogs from a Fortinet firewall.

## Setup Overview

In a previous post, I talked about how to install Elasticsearch and Kibana and
configure them so that we can login to the Kibana user interface and look at our data.
Now we will see how Logstash will get us the data in Elasticsearch.

## Installing Logstash

I will try to keep this post short and straight to the point. There is a lot more to this rich tool explained in the documentation.

Switch to superuser

```bash
sudo su
```

Update applications installed on a system

```bash
dnf update
```

Now we will start installing Logstash from a package repository. Run the following command to install the public signing key:

```bash
rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
```

Create the following .repo file and add the content below:

```bash
vim /etc/yum.repos.d/logstash.repo
```

and paste the following then save the file:

```bash
[logstash-8.x]
name=Elastic repository for 8.x packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=1
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md
```

The repository is ready to be installed:

```bash
dnf install logstash
```

## Configuring Logstash

Configure the Syslog server using the commands below. My Logstash server IP is 192.168.25.110:

```bash
config log syslogd setting
    set status enable
    set server "192.168.25.110"
    set mode udp
    set port 5144
    set facility local7
    set source-ip ''
    set format default
    set priority default
    set max-log-rate 0
    set interface-select-method auto
end
```

To configure Logstash, we need to create a new .conf file in the following directory:

```bash
vim /etc/logstash/conf.d/firewall.conf
```

The Logstash pipeline consists of inputs, filters, and outputs plugins.
It receives data from a source on the input plugin, modifies the data using the filter plugins, and sends to Elasticsearch using the output plugin.
Here is the configuration file that will receive logs from the FortiGate firewall, parse and send them to Elasticsearch:

```bash
# Input plugin that will receive the logs on port 5144
# on the specified host interface IP
######################################

input {
 udp {
    host => "192.168.25.110"
    port => 5144
  }
}

# Filter plugins that will modify the logs
##########################################

filter {
  grok {
    match => {"message" => "%{SYSLOG5424PRI}%{GREEDYDATA:message}" }
    overwrite => [ "message" ]
  }
  mutate {
    remove_field => ["@timestamp","host","@version","event","log"]
  }
  kv {
    field_split => " "
  }
  mutate {
    remove_field => ["message"]
    add_field => { "logdate" => "%{date} %{time}" }
  }
  date {
    match => [ "logdate", "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss" ]
    timezone => "America/Edmonton"
    target => "@timestamp"
  }
  mutate {
    remove_field => ["logdate","date","time"]
    convert => { "rcvdbyte" => "integer" }
    convert => { "sentbyte" => "integer" }
  }
}

# Output plugin to send the logs to Elasticsearch
#################################################

output {
  #stdout {}    # Use stdout to see the output on the console during testing
  elasticsearch {
    hosts => ["https://192.168.25.100"]
    index => "firewall-%{+YYYY.MM.dd}"
    user => "elastic"
    password => "password"
    ssl => true
    cacert => "/etc/logstash/http_ca.crt"
  }
}
```

Configure the firewall on this machine, allow communication to port 9200/tcp:

```bash
firewall-cmd --add-port=5144/udp --permanent
firewall-cmd --reload
```

To authenticate to Elasticsearch, I copied the CA certificate from the Elasticsearch node to the Logstash configuration directory /etc/logstash/

I adjusted the permissions on http_ca.crt to give Logstash access to the certificate file:

```bash
chmod 660 /etc/logstash/http_ca.crt
chown root:logstash /etc/logstash/http_ca.crt
```

Then we can start Logstash and run it as a service with:

```bash
systemctl start logstash
```
