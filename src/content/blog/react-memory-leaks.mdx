Computers don’t have unlimited resources and some browsers are eating a lot of memory even for a few open tabs.
If most of them have memory leaks, it can really slow down your computer. For react developers, optimization can
be a bit of a headache if not properly done, or not done at all. Memory leaks can destroy your project
and cost a big amount of money and time. Let's try to understand why and how we can clean up memory leaks.

## What is a memory leak?

In React, a memory leak is a type of resource leak that occurs when an application
incorrectly manages memory allocations. That memory, which is not needed anymore,
is not released for other processes to use. A memory leak may also happen when an
object is stored in a memory, but cannot be accessed by the running code.

Once you have a memory leak, you will get a similar error in console log:

_Warning: Can’t perform a React state update on an unmounted component. This is a no-op,
but it indicates a memory leak in your application. To fix, cancel all subscriptions
and asynchronous tasks in the componentWillUnmount method._

## Why should you clean up memory leaks?

Memory leaks are commonly faced issues when developing React applications. It causes many problems, including:

- Affecting the project’s performance by reducing the amount of available memory;
- Slowing down the application;
- Refreshing the page randomly;
- Crashing the system;
- Overloading database with huge amounts of queries;

Let’s say you are building an application with React and Firebase for database.
You create your website which interacts with Firebase a lot. And just after a few hours,
you hit 50k read limit of the day. You check that the only user was you.
How is that possible?! Now your website is down and will not work for the day
just because you didn’t clean up memory leaks.

## What causes a memory leak?

A memory leak appears when React applications created subscriptions that were
made when a component was mounted and did not unsubscribe them when those components were unmounted.

These subscriptions could be:

- DOM Event listeners;
- WebSocket subscriptions;
- Requests to an API;
