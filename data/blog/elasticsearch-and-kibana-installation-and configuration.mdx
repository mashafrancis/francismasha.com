I want us to explore how to install and configure Elasticsearch and Kibana, to get a cluster ready for ingesting logs for any server.
I will be using Rocky Linux (Redhat family) for this setup, and installing Elasticsearch and Kibana as RPM packages.

Elasticsearch is an open-source search and analytics engine. It is a free tool to store and quickly search data, manage and view it with Kibana, with a lot of features such as: indexing several types of data from different appliances, Data Analytics and Observability, Machine Learning, SIEM, Endpoint Security and many more.
A cluster consists of a number of nodes, but for the purpose of this setup, I will be configuring a one-node cluster in addition to one Kibana instance.

## Installing Elasticsearch

The installation on this article is based on RHEL version 8, you can use yum instead of dnf.

Switch to superuser

```bash
sudo su
```

Update applications installed on a system

```bash
dnf update
```

Install vim editor - the colored editor may indicate errors in the config files

```bash
dnf -y install vim
```

Install java. You can specify the version and release you desire.

```bash
dnf -y install java
```

Import the elasticsearch GnuPG key

```bash
rpm --import https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
```

Create a file called `elasticsearch.repo` in the `/etc/yum.repos.d/` directory with the command

```bash
vim /etc/yum.repos.d/elasticsearch.repo
```

and paste the following then save the file:

```bash
[elasticsearch]
name=Elasticsearch repository for  8.x packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=0
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md
```

Install Elasticsearch

```bash
dnf install --enablerepo=elasticsearch elasticsearch
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable elasticsearch.service
systemctl start elasticsearch.service
```
