When you have just installed Elasticsearch and Kibana, if you open the monitoring page you will probably see this screen:

## Setup Overview

Kibana informs us that we have not yet configured monitoring on our
cluster. This is what we are going to do today by following these steps:

- Install Metricbeat on the system to be monitored
- Send the metrics to Elasticsearch
- View these metrics on Kibana

## Installing Metricbeat

I will try to keep this post short and straight to the point. There is a
lot more to this rich tool explained in the documentation.

Switch to superuser

```bash
sudo su
```

Update applications installed on a system

```bash
dnf update
```

Now we will start installing Logstash from a package repository. Run the
following command to install the public signing key:

```bash
rpm --import https://packages.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
```

Create (if it does not exist) the following .repo file and add the content
below:

```bash
vim /etc/yum.repos.d/elastic.repo
```

and paste the following then save the file:

```text
[elastic-8.x]
name=Elastic repository for 8.x packages
baseurl=https://artifacts.elastic.co/packages/8.x/yum
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://artifacts.elastic.co/GPG-KEY-elasticsearch
enabled=1
autorefresh=1
type=rpm-md
```

The repository is ready to be installed:

```bash
dnf install metricbeat
```

Configure Metricbeat to start automatically during boot, run:

```bash
systemctl enable metricbeat
```

If your system does not use systemd then run:

```bash
chkconfig --add metricbeat
```

## Configuring Metricbeat

<callout-warning>
	This will configure without a secure communication protocol. We shall set up
	security ssl on a later post.
</callout-warning>

Open the configuration file `/etc/metricbeat/metricbeat.yml`. We shall
define a few parameters. Go to output section and add this configuration to connect Elasticsearch.

```yaml
output.elasticsearch:
hosts: ["localhost:9200"]
protocol: "https"
username: "elastic"
password: "${ES_PWD}"
ssl.verification_mode: none
```

To configure Logstash, we need to create a new .conf file in the following
directory:

Replace these values with those of your environment. It is not advisable to
fill in sensitive information here,
instead you should store sensitive values in the secrets keystore.

```bash
metricbeat keystore create
metricbeat keystore add ES_PWD
```

Metricbeat comes with a set of utilities to check if configuration or
connectivity is in place.
Run the following commands, one after the other to test your configuration and output.

```bash
metricbeat test config
metricbeat test output
```

Next, let’s enable and configure the Elasticsearch x-pack module in
Metricbeat. Run the following command:

```bash
metricbeat modules enable elasticsearch-xpack
```

You should have as return: `Enabled elasticsearch-xpack`.

Since security is enabled, additional configurations are required. So let’s
open the file: modules.d/elasticsearch-xpack.yml and add this information:

```yaml
- module: elasticsearch
  xpack.enabled: true
  period: 10s
```

Restart metricbeat and you shall start seeing your metrics on the dashboard

```bash
systemctl restart metricbeat
```
