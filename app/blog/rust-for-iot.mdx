In this article, I explore these thoughts I have been experimenting on for a while:

- What does it look in practice to start a new projects based on rust in the world of IoT, specifically embedded development on bare metal?
- Can we use this promising language for new projects in a production environment?
- Does rust make us develop more maintainable applications faster while keeping our code safe?

## Hardware and setup

```rust
# Install the required nightly toolchain
rustup install nightly
rustup component add rust-src --toolchain nightly
rustup target add riscv32imc-unknown-none-elf

# Install tooling to check the size of our binary
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview

# Install helper packages for a smooth development workflow
cargo install cargo-generate
cargo install ldproxy
cargo install espflash
cargo install espmonitor

# Generate template project
cargo generate --vcs none --git https://github.com/esp-rs/esp-idf-template cargo

# CD Into your project folder, compile and flash the application
cd <my-project-dir>
cargo build && espflash --speed 406800 target/riscv32imc-esp-espidf/debug/wireprobe-rs
```
